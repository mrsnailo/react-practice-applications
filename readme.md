## Practice Projects (React) 

### Current projects

```
.
├── courseGoal
├── courseReg
├── expenseAnalysis
├── portfolio
├── udemyCourse
└── userManagement
```

> The folder names for all the projects are self-explanatory, so I guess I don't need much of a description.

- [courseGoal](https://github.com/mrsnailo/react-practice-applications/tree/main/courseGoal) - A simple ui to add course as needed and remove them. 
- [courseReg](mrsnailo-cr.netlify.app) - Functionality to add courses to cart based on some conditions with a elegant ui 
- [expenseAnalysis](https://github.com/mrsnailo/react-practice-applications/tree/main/expenseAnalysis) - My first React application. It has functionality to add expenses and analyze them with a simple graph.
- [udemyCourse](https://github.com/mrsnailo/react-practice-applications/tree/main/udemyCourse) - As the name suggests, I will store all the demo projects here for practicing different aspects of the React library.
- [userManagement](https://github.com/mrsnailo/react-practice-applications/tree/main/userManagement) - Similar to courseGoal, with slight differences in approach.


#### I will write a better description when i have the time
